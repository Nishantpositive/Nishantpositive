# Reading List

The modern day reading list includes more than just books. We've created a dashboard to help you track books, articles, podcasts, and videos. **Each** **media type** has its own view based on the **Type** property. 

Change your views to sort content by status, author, type, or publisher ✓
Rate content out of 5 stars ✓

One more thing... if you install [Notion Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk?hl=en), you can save pages and links off the web directly to these lists.

Click on `Articles` to see what other views might have in store or add your own ✨
